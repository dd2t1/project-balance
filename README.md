# ESPHome HX711 Weight Sensor with ESP32-S3

This project configures an ESP32-S3 development board to use a HX711 weight sensor for real-time weight measurements. The ESP32-S3 is integrated with ESPHome, allowing communication via Wi-Fi and MQTT to a local broker. The sensor data is calibrated and optimized with filters to ensure accuracy.

## Features

- **HX711 Weight Sensor**: Measures weight using a load cell and HX711 ADC.
- **Wi-Fi Integration**: Connects to the local network for data transmission.
- **MQTT Support**: Publishes weight data to an MQTT broker.
- **OTA Updates**: Over-the-air firmware updates for easy maintenance.
- **Filters & Calibration**: Includes linear calibration and delta filtering to reduce unnecessary updates.

## Hardware

- **ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1**: Main microcontroller.
- **HX711**: Analog-to-digital converter for the load cell.
- **Load Cell**: Measures weight.
  
## Wiring

- **DOUT (HX711)** → GPIO 1 (ESP32-S3)
- **CLK (HX711)** → GPIO 2 (ESP32-S3)

## Configuration

### Wi-Fi & MQTT

Modify the Wi-Fi SSID, password, and MQTT broker address in the `esphome` YAML file.

```yaml
wifi:
  ssid: "Your-WiFi-SSID"
  password: "Your-WiFi-Password"

mqtt:
  broker: "*** *** ***  # Update with your broker IP address
```
Calibration
The HX711 sensor is calibrated with two reference points:

702796 corresponds to 0g.
848243 corresponds to 180g.
Adjust these values in the calibrate_linear filter to match your sensor's characteristics.

Installation
Flash the ESP32-S3 with ESPHome firmware.
Connect the ESP32-S3 to your Wi-Fi network.
Connect the MQTT broker to receive weight data.
Adjust the calibration values for accurate weight measurements.
Usage
## Part 2: Node-RED Integration

The project also includes a Node-RED flow for processing and visualizing the data from the ESPHome device. The flow integrates MQTT to receive data from the ESP32-S3 and handles plate recognition using the Plate Recognizer API.

### Node-RED Flow

The flow consists of several key components:

1. **MQTT Input**: Subscribes to the MQTT topic `home/sensor/poids/state` to receive the weight data from the ESP32-S3.

2. **Plate Recognizer Integration**: A Plate Recognizer node processes the received image to detect vehicle license plates.

3. **Function Node**: Generates a random image path to simulate the input of different images for the Plate Recognizer API.

4. **File Input Node**: Reads the image file based on the path generated by the function node.

5. **Debug and Visualization Nodes**: Output the recognized data and allow image viewing.

### Node-RED Flow Configuration

To use this flow, import the following JSON into Node-RED:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "38586517.a5bf9a",
        "type": "plate-recognizer",
        ...
    },
    {
        "id": "e4699284.081c7",
        "type": "inject",
        ...
    },
    ...
]
```

MQTT Topics
Weight Data: home/sensor/poids/state
License Plate Set: home/sensor/immatriculation/set
License Plate State: home/sensor/immatriculation/state
Plate Recognizer API
The Plate Recognizer API is used to detect license plates from images. You will need to sign up for an API key and add it to the Plate Recognizer node in your flow.

How to Use
Deploy the Node-RED flow after importing the JSON configuration.
Ensure the ESP32-S3 is publishing weight data via MQTT.
The flow will process the data, send images to the Plate Recognizer API, and display the results in the Node-RED debug sidebar and image viewer.
Visualization
Weight Data: View weight data changes in the Node-RED debug sidebar.
License Plate Recognition: Display detected license plates via the Plate Recognizer API and Node-RED's image viewer node.
